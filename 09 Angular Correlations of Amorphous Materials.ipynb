Even small distortions in the pattern or misinterpertation of the center of the diffraction pattern will negitively affect the ability to determine correlations.\n",

In general your eye should be very good at identifying that.  Another thing to notice is that after the correlation if you have small splititing in all of your peaks(especially the self correlation) then most likely your center isn't completely correct."
